This is VILLASnode, a gateway for processing and forwardning simulation data between real-time simulators.
VILLASnode is a client/server application to connect simulation equipment and software such as:

 - OPAL-RT RT-LAB,
 - RTDS GTFPGA cards,
 - RTDS GTWIF cards,
 - Simulink,
 - LabView,
 - and FPGA models

by using protcols such as:

 - IEEE 802.2 Ethernet / IP / UDP,
 - ZeroMQ & nanomsg,
 - MQTT & AMQP
 - WebSockets
 - Shared Memory
 - Files
 - IEC 61850 Sampled Values / GOOSE
 - Analog/Digital IO via Comedi drivers
 - Infiniband (ibverbs)

It's designed with a focus on very low latency to achieve real-time exchange of simulation data.
VILLASnode is used in distributed- and co-simulation scenarios and developed for the field of power grid simulation at the EON Energy Research Center in Aachen, Germany.
